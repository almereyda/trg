# Ter

A tiny wiki engine with [Zettelkasten](zettelkasten.md) flavor.

Ter takes a folder of markdown files and replicates its structure into a static
site with automatically [indexed](usage/overview#index-pages) directories,
[backlinks](usage/overview#backlinks) and [crumbs](usage/overview#crumbs).

### Some quick links

- see [usage](usage) on how to get started
- [goals](goals.md) for some thinking behind Ter's approach
- [deploy](usage/deploy.md) on how to publish a site
- or feel free to just roam around

### Open source

Ter is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
[Deno](https://deno.land). Deno is fun.<br/>Contribute or submit issues:
