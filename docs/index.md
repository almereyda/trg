# Ter

Ter is a tiny wiki engine with [Zettelkasten](zettelkasten.md) flavor.

Ter takes a folder of markdown files and replicates its structure into a static
site with automatically [indexed](features/index-pages.md) directories,
[backlinks](features/backlinks.md) and [breadcrumbs](features/breadcrumbs.md).

- see [use cases](use-cases.md) for some thinking behind Ter's approach
- [features](features/index.md) for a full overview
- [usage](usage.md) on how to get started
- or feel free to just roam around

Ter is open source. Contribute or submit issues:
