# Ter

Ter is a tiny wiki engine with [Zettelkasten](zettelkasten.md) flavor.

Ter takes a folder of markdown files and replicates its structure into a static
site with automatically [indexed](index-pages.md) directories,
[backlinks](backlinks.md) and [breadcrumbs](breadcrumbs.md).

- see [use cases](use-cases.md) for some thinking behind Ter's approach
- [features](features.md) for a full overview
- [usage](usage.md) on how to get started
- or feel free to just roam around
