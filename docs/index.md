# Ter

Welcome to Ter demo site! Ter is a tiny wiki engine with
[Zettelkasten](zettelkasten.md) flavor. It takes a folder of markdown files and
replicates its structure into a static site with automatically
[indexed](features#index-pages) directories, [backlinks](features#backlinks) and
[breadcrumbs](features#breadcrumbs).

### Some quick links

- see [goals and use cases](goals-and-use-cases.md) for some thinking behind
  Ter's approach
- [features](features.md) for a full overview
- [usage](usage.md) on how to get started
- or feel free to just roam around

### Open source

Ter is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
[Deno](https://deno.land). Deno is fun.<br/>Contribute or submit issues:

This is pre-alpha software. It can not damage your files, but some
aspects of site generation are in flux.
