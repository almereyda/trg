A tiny wiki engine with [Zettelkasten](zettelkasten.md) flavor.

Ter takes a folder of markdown files and replicates its structure into a static
site with automatically [indexed](usage#index-pages) directories and backlinks.

- see [usage](usage) on how to get started
- [goals](goals.md) for some thinking behind Ter's approach
- or feel free to just roam around

Made with [Deno](https://deno.land). Deno is fun. Contribute or submit issues:
