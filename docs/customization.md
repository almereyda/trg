Ter should work out of the box with zero configuration needed to get a decent
output. However, it's possible to customize various aspects of the rendered
website.

The following customization options are outdated as Ter recently switched to
server-side Preact rendering.

This is done to avoid having any extra files in the directory and potentially
having outdated templates/styles. Simplicity > customization. I might add an
option to use local Preact components for rendering in future.

## Styles

Main page styles are defined in `.ter/assets/ter.css`. The content-related CSS
is mostly classless to avoid depending on specific classes from the
[template](#templates).

### Code highlights

Code snippets are highlighted by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) and use
the theme defined in `.ter/assets/hljs.css`, which can be replaced by any
highlight.js-compatible theme file.

## Templates

Ter uses [Eta](https://eta.js.org/) templates to build pages. Itâ€™s possible to
customize the output by changing the default view files in `.ter/views/`.
