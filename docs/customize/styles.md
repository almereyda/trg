# Styles

## Page styles

Main page styles are defined in `_assets/ter.css`. The CSS is fully classless to
avoid depending on specific classes from the [template](templates.md).

## Code highlights

Code snippets are highlighted by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) and use
the theme defined in `_assets/hljs.css`, which can be replaced by any
highlight.js-compatible theme file.
