# Styles

## Page styles

Main page styles are defined in `.ter/assets/ter.css`. The CSS is mostly
classless to avoid depending on specific classes from the
[template](templates.md).

## Code highlights

Code snippets are highlighted by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) and use
the theme defined in `.ter/assets/hljs.css`, which can be replaced by any
highlight.js-compatible theme file.
