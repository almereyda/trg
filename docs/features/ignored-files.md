# Ignored files

Any files and folders that start with an `_` or `.` (hidden) are ignored.

For example, if there is a `_drafts` folder in the content directory, it will be
skipped during site generation.

In addition, itâ€™s also possible to ignore individual markdown files by setting
either `private: true` or `draft: true` in the
[YAML frontmatter](frontmatter.md).
