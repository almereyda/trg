# Goals and use cases

Ter tries to solve some specific use-cases effortlessly, rather than being a
full-fledged static site builder.

If any of the following goals and use-cases sound relevant, Ter might be for
you.

## Goals

- The filesystem is the navigation and organization method;
- Creating a new page (or category) should be as easy as creating a file (or
  directory);
- No bundled JavaScript -- it's just a bunch of hyperlinked documents, after
  all;
- Work out of the box, simplicity > customization.

## Use cases

- A published [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki);
- A collection of [Zettelkasten](./zettelkasten.md) notes;
- A simple blog;
- Software documentation (just like the one you're currently browsing).

If you're looking for a real static site generator, try something like
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) or [Astro](https://astro.build/).
